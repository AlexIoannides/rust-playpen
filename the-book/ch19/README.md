# Chapter 19 - Advanced Features

There are many features that are labelled as "advanced" - the ones highlighted in this section are those that struck me as being of most use (at least initially):

- 1st class functions;
- type aliases and traits with placeholder types;
- automatically deriving traits; and,
- operator overloading.
